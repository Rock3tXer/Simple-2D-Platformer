# Simple 2D platformer
## Made with UNITY
This game was made as my final exam project for school.
During the creation I learned a bit of pixel art and C# basics used with UNITY.

### Content
This game contains only 1 level that is made up from 3 zones:
- Zone 1: Dark purple biome
- Zone 2: Brighter ice biome
- Zone 3: A forest biome

#### Goal
Goal of this game is to get through the last door in Zone 3 while avoiding spikes that are scattered around. 
There is a key located in every zone which is needed to proceed to the next zone.
There are also coins which serve no actual gameplay meaning. They are just there.

#### Controls
To move your character use these keys:
- To move left use **a** or **left_arrow**
- To move right use **d** or **right_arrow**
- To jump use **space**
